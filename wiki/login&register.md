# Login and Registration Wiki

## Introduction

The login and registration guide for both our app and website. This document provides a detailed explanation of the process of accessing your account and creating a new one,
including the frontend, backend, and security considerations.
Login and registration are fundamental features of our netflix system, and designed to allow users to authenticate securely and access personalized features.

## Authentication
- Login Credentials: When a user attempts to log in, they provide their credentials, in our case a username and password.
  
- Client-Server Interaction: Upon entering their credentials, the client (such as a web browser or mobile app) sends a login request to the server. This request contains the user's credentials.

- Server-Side Verification: If a user is found in the system, a JWT token is created, encrypted with a private key which is returned in the body of a response with information about the user. A token is passed in each request as an "Authorization" HTTP header. If not found or expired - a response with a ststus 401 error is returned to the client side.

- In case of registration: A username is transferred from the client side. On the server side, it is checked whether a username already exists in the system.
If it does - a response is returned with 'ok' status code. Otherwise, a new user is registered in the DB.
Logout: When the user chooses to log out, the session is terminated, and any associated session tokens or cookies are invalidated. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's account.
